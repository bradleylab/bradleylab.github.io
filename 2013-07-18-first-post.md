## First Post

This is my first attempt to write a post for a website, using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "that was easy"). I'll need to figure out how to make the link

I'm pretty sure getting it to post won't be a problem, but I'm still not quite sure how to set up the index.html file, the CSS and javascript etc. I think it's worth investing a bit more time before bailing and going back to ExpressionEngine or WordPress
