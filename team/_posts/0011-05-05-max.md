Max is an undergraduate student at Washington University, class of 2016. He is a Chemistry major and is studying enzymes of sulfate reducing bacteria. His work involves _in vitro_ expression of these enzymes, developing methods for isolation of their reactants and products. These techniques will be used to determine _in vitro_ sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionations.
