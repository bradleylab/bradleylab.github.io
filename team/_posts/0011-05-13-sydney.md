Sydney is working with [Amanda Bender](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/amanda/) working on the [plant wax project](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/research/plantwaxes/) to try to discern differences in  bulk isotopic compositions of closely related plants, as well as isotopic differences in long chain fatty acids derived from leaf waxes.
