Alex is an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University, and is also affiliated with the <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu">Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences</a>. He has been at WashU since July 2012, after finishing postdoctoral work at Harvard and a Ph.D. at MIT. 

Alex is interested in a wide range of biogeochemical and geobiological problems. In particular, he is interested in organic geochemistry - understanding where geologically stable molecular structures come from and what information is encoded in their structures and isotopes. He is also very interested in understanding biological controls on isotope fractionation in other systems, such as sulfate reduction.
