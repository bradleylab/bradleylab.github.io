Flavia Boidi is a student working with Fernando Gomez on the microbiology of [Laguna Negra](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/research/lagunanegra/), Argentina. She is visiting Washington University in Fall 2015 and Winter 2016 to cultivate microbes and further examine the microbiology of this ecosystem. She'll be working closely with [Scott](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/scott/), who is using organic geochemistry to characterize these mats.
