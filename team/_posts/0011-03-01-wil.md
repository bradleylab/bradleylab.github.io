Wil is the department's second Fossett Postdoctoral Fellow and joined the research group in July 2014. His interests are in geomicrobiology and geobiology. After completing a Ph.D. in sulfur isotope biogeochemistry at Harvard University in Dave Johnston's lab, he came to Washington University where he'll pursue further studies in biogeochemical sulfur and methane cycling.
