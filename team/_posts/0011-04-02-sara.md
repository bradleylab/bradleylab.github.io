Sara is a graduate student in Biology at Washington University, and rotated in the Bradley lab during spring semester, 2013. Sara is interested in plant evolution, but spent her rotation studying experimentally evolved lines of _Methylobacterium_ and preparing them for genome sequencing. 

Sara is originally from Texas, and is still getting used to the (very) occasional snow that falls in St. Louis.
