Provides an opportunity for advanced undergraduates to synthesize many of the diverse subdisciplines of Earth and Planetary Sciences while focussing on a research topic.Subject changes each offering. Each subject will be unique and timely, but broad enough to encompass wide-ranging interests among students. Students will conduct original research, make written reports of the results, and make oral presentations of their projects in class. Prerequisite: senior standing or permission of instructor.
