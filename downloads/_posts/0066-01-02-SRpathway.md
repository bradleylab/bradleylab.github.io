A set of R scripts used to calculate &#948;<sup>34</sup>S and &#948;<sup>33</sup>S fractionations through our inferred sulfate reduction network topology, given user input fractionation factors at each step. Described in our [2011 Geobiology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884365) paper. The [scripts are available](https://github.com/bradleylab/SRBmodel "SRBmodel") on GitHub. Please fork the repository, and if you find errors or make improvements, send a pull request.
