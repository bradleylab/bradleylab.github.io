        About the Lab</h3>
		
        <p>We study the biogeochemistry and geobiology of natural systems, with an emphasis on molecular products of life the can be preserved in the geological record. This leads us to try to understand the structures and isotopic compositions of natural products, the genes and regulatory networks required for their biosynthesis , the physiological conditions that lead to their biosynthesis, and the information that they contain. We conduct both field and laboratory investigations to try to gain a better understanding of local and global biogeochemical cycles, and how these have evolved over Earth history. </p>

        <p>This is yet another beautifully formatted paragraph. We need enough to take up lots of space. It looks like it is anchored, has an anchor link, it has a span class, and some very nicely formatted text. It would be very useful to look up the css and figure out just exactly what is going on here. At least we finally got hte width to extend across teh whol econtainer. I'm going to delete the rest of the paragraphs because they are all essentially the same, and they are confusing me. </p>
