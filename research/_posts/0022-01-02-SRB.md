Sulfate reduction a form of energy metabolism that has existed on Earth for billions of years. It is a metabolic strategy of many Bacteria and some Archaea. Sulfate reduction operates using sulfate to oxidize hydrogen or organic material, thereby producing sulfide. Sulfur has several stable isotopes, including <sup>32</sup>S, <sup>33</sup>S, and <sup>34</sup>S - and the process of sulfate reduction doesn't convert them all at the same rate, slightly favoring the lighter isotopes such as <sup>32</sup>S. This results in sulfide having a lower <sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S ratio than sulfate. The process of creating this difference is an _isotope fractionation_. 

We are interested in understanding the biological and environmental controls on the magnitude of this isotope fractionation. Because both sulfate and sulfide can be preserved in sedimentary rocks - for example, sulfate in gypsum and sulfate in sulfide - we can measure how the average isotope fractionation has changed over Earth history. We'd like to better understand how to interpret this, and so are conducting a range of experiments with sulfate reducing cultures and enzymes.
