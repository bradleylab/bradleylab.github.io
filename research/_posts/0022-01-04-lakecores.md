The Mississippian culture was a pre-Columbian culture in North America, that peaked around AD 1200 and built large population centers up and down the Mississipi valley. This civilization is most famous for mound-building, with the largest site occurring at [Cahokia, Illinois](http://www.cahokiamounds.org). 

The enduring questions about this civilization relate to the timing of its appearance and disappearance, and the factors that drove this. We are working with [Sam Munoz](https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/semunoz/web/SEMunoz.htm) and [Jack Wiliams](http://www.geography.wisc.edu/faculty/williams/lab/), using lake cores to collect paleoenvironmental data related to this culture. Our lab is focused on the distribution and isotopic content of leaf waxes in these sediments.
