The GC-IRMS is an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Like the GCMS, it has a GC on the front end. This is coupled by an interface to the IRMS. The interface is either a combustion reactor that converts the carbon in organic compounds to CO<sub>2</sub> for analysis of carbon isotopes, or a pyrolysis reactor that converts the hydrogen in each compound to H<sub>2</sub> for analysis of D/H ratios. The IRMS itself has a filament to ionize the gas, a flight tube down which ions are accelerated, a magnet to separate ions, and five Faraday cups to measure ion currents.
