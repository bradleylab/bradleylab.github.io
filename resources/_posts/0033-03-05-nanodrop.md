The nanodrop 2000c is a combination cuvette spectrophotometer and micro-spectrophotometer, capable of analyzing samples as small as one microliter. We use it for quantifying DNA and protein, for measuring the optical density of microbial cultures, and for quantifying other samples that absorb in the UV-visible range, such as carotenoids.
