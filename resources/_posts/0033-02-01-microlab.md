The microbiology laboratory is where we do most of the work related to culturing of microorganisms - streaking cultures on plates, picking colonies, extracting DNA, setting up PCR reactions. It has a biological safety cabinet, a gassing station, a fume hood, centrifuges, thermocycler, gel rig and box, and spectrophotometer.
