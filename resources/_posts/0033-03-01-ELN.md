All notes and data in our laboratory are recorded electronically. We use a state-of-the art Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) system called _[Biovia Notebook Cloud](http://accelrys.com/micro/notebook-cloud/)_ to record and curate all data. This has the advantage of making it easy to find data and collaborate, to store protocols, and to quickly search for past experiments. It also makes the data portable, facilitating collaboration outside the laboratory.
