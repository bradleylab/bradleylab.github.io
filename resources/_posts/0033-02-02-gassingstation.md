The gassing station owes its existence to Wil Leavitt. It is custom-built in the laboratory to strip residual oxygen from gases that we use as headspace in sealed microbiological vessels for the growth of anaerobic microbes. Its basic operation consists of running a gas stream over a heated catalyst, then through a 0.45 micron filter into the sample headspace.
