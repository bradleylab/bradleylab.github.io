The GCMS is actually two instruments. A gas chromatograph (GC) that contains a column that can separate organic compounds. Second, a quadropole mass spectrometer (MS) that first ionizes each compound eluting from the GC, and then analyzes its mass fragments. Various organic compounds have distinct molecular fingerprints (mass spectra) that can be used, along with their elution time on the GC, to identify them.
