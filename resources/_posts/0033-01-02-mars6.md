The CEM Mars6 Microwave Reaction System is used to perform many of the organic extractions in the laboratory. Much like a home microwave, it heats up the sample in a teflon vessel along with organic solvents. Unlike a home microwave, it has precise temperature control. After organic extraction, solvents are removed from the sample for further processing.
