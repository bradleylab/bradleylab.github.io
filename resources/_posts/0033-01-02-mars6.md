The CEM Mars6 Microwave Reaction System is used to perform many of the organic extractions in the laboratory. In this system, the material to be extracted is contained in a teflon vessel, along with a mixture of organic solvents chosen to be appropriate based on the nature of the sample and the targeted compounds. The sample is then heated with microwave radiation. It works very much like a home microwave oven, but with very precise temperature control. Moderately high temperatures (typically around 70 degrees Celsius) assist in extraction of organic compounds from the sample into the solvent mixture, which can be removed for further processing.
