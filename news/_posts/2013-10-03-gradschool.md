Our  lab group is growing! We are seeking one or two new graduate students to join us in the Fall of 2014. Prospective students would work on projects in the fields of organic geochemistry,  biogeochemistry, and/or geobiology and projects could be collaborative across research groups. 

[Applications] (http://graduateschool.wustl.edu/prospective_students/apply-now) should be submitted through the graduate school to the [Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences] (http://eps.wustl.edu/), or to the [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences] (http://dbbs.wustl.edu/), as appropriate for each student's background and interests. Please contact [Alex] (http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) with any questions.
