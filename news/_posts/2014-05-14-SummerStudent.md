We now have an opening for an undergraduate student to participate in a research project involving study of hydrogen isotopes in leaf waxes. Leaf waxes are a widely used paleoclimate proxy in geochemistry, and we are investigating biological sources of variability. This position is open part- or full-time during the summer, for credit or pay, with the option to develop an undergraduate research or thesis project. Please contact [Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) if you are interested.
