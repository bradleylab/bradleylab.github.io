A new [TC/EA](http://www.thermoscientific.com/en/product/tc-ea-high-temperature-conversion-elemental-analyzer.html) and [Thermo Delta V Plus](http://www.thermoscientific.com/en/product/delta-v-plus-isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometer.html) isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer have arrived at the Bradley Lab. These instruments, along with an elemental analyzer, will installed as part of a research collaboration with [Xinyi Liu](https://anthropology.artsci.wustl.edu/liu_xinyi) in the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.artsci.wustl.edu). This brings new analytical capabilities to our campus and we're looking forward to making new measurements!
