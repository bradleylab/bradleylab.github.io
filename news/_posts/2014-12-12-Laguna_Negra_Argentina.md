[Scott] (http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/scott/) and [Alex] (http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/), along with [David Fike](http://biogeochem.wustl.edu/?page_id=5) and [Fernando Gomez](http://www.efn.uncor.edu/investigacion/LACS/fernando.htm) have just returned from the Andes of Argentina, where they have been collecting samples at [Laguna Negra](https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.6402809,-68.5762433,28937m/data=!3m1!1e3), on the route to the summit of [Monte Pissis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Pissis). This lake is a high altitude hypersaline lake in which we see the development of modern oncoids and stromatolites, as well as abundant microbial mats. Our objective is to characterize the carbon and sulfur cycling in the mats and carbonates, and draw comparisons to similar structures that can be seen in ancient carbonates. 

In addition to sampling the lake, we surveyed Cambrian, Ordovician, and Triassic deposits in the Argentine Precordillera. Some of these are the focus of upcoming geological and geochemical work.
