Microbial sulfur metabolism is one of the core focuses of the laboratory, and of great interest to biogeochemists worldwide. [Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) and [Wil](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/wil/), along with [David Fike](http://biogeochem.wustl.edu/?page_id=5) have just returned from a [workshop in Helsingør, Denmark](http://events.embo.org/15-microbial/) where they conferred with European and American colleagues about new advances and approaches to the study of the sulfur cycle. The workshop was extremely informative and we plan on quickly putting to use much of what we have learned!
