This weekend, most of our laboratory is off to Indianapolis for the 2nd annual [Midwest Geobiology Symposium](http://www.midwestgeobiology.org). We are excited to catch up with the local geobiology community, present our current research, and see what everyone has been up to since our last meeting in September 2012. 

A group of fourteen scientists from Washington University will be attending, including those from our lab.  WashU will be represented by two undergraduates, and several graduate students, research scientists, and faculty.
