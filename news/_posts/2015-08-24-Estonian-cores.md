As the fall semester kicks off, Alex has just returned from a trip that included several days of sampling spectacular [Estonian core material](http://geokogud.info). The sampled rocks span the Ediacaran to the Silurian and will form the basis of a new project to understand carbon and sulfur cycling through these periods. This work will be spearheaded by incoming graduate student [Ming Wu](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/ming/) and involves collaborations with [David Fike](https://eps.wustl.edu/people/dave_fike), [Olle Hints](https://www.etis.ee/portaal/isikuCV.aspx?PersonVID=36876) and others.
