## A New Website

Our new lab website is finally up and running! We've moved to a new way of handling the site, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to render a static site, and [Prose](http://prose.io) to do all the editing. Much easier than the old system...

We'll be adding content here as it develops.
