[Flavia Boidi](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/flavia), a student from Argentina working with [Fernando Gomez](http://www.efn.uncor.edu/investigacion/LACS/fernando.htm), has arrived in St. Louis on a Fulbright fellowship to work for several months on the microbiology of [Laguna Negra](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/research/lagunanegra/). She'll be working closely with [Scott](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/scott/) to characterize the microbes inhabiting the microbial mats of this lake, and pair that analysis with organic biomarkers and isotopes. Welcome to the lab!
