The fall 2013 semester is underway at Washington University, and there are some new faces in the laboratory. Sophomore Max Lyons has joined us, and will be working on isotope fractionation during the process of sulfate reduction. Sydney Kapp is also a new member of the lab and will be working on a genetics project in _Methylobacterium_. Welcome to both Sydney and Max!
