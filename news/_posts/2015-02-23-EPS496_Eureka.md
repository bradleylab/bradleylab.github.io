[EPS 496](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/courses/) took a field trip yesterday to the local outcrops near Eureka, Missouri where we examined the Plattin, Decorah, and Kimmswick limestones. [Phil Skemer](http://espm.wustl.edu/people/skemer/) and [Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) led the group in preparation for an upcoming field excursion to Italy focusing on the geology of the Apennines. Despite the cold, the trip was a great success!
