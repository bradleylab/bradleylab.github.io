Spring semester at Washington University is underway! The semester kicked off this past week, and we have a great enrollment in our course [EPS 323: Biogeochemistry](http://eps.wustl.edu/courses/wucrsl/L19/323/SP2014). 

Michael Bereisha, a junior Biochemistry major, joins the laboratory this semester, and will be delving into the world of molecular biology and cloning. Welcome Michael!

We are all looking forward to a busy and productive semester!
