The [26th IMOG (International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry)](http://www.imog2013.org/) is underway next week, and we are headed off to see what's new in the broader world of organic geochemistry. Our laboratory will be presenting some preliminary work that we've done to try to start to get a better handle on the origin of D/H ratios in microbial lipids.
