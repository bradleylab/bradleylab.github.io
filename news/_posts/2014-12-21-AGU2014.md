[Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) and [Wil](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/wil/) have spent the last week in San Francisco, attending the [2014 Fall Meeting](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2014/) of the American Geophysical Union. Alex presented some preliminary work on the controls of D/H ratios in microbial lipids, while Wil discussed enzyme-level controls on sulfur isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction. Altogether, a productive meeting, and looking forward to 2015!
