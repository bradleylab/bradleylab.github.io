 The [Bradley](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu), [Fike](http://biogeochem.wustl.edu), and [Catalano](http://envgeochem.wustl.edu/) labs have caravaned up to Chicago for the [Midwest Geobiology Symposium 2014](http://www.midwestgeobiology.org)! This year's conference is hosted at Chicago's [Field Museum](http://www.fieldmuseum.org/), and includes fifteen attendees from Washington University. We look forward to an exciting weekend of science, socializing, and building new collaborations with our colleagues from across the midwest. Special thanks are due to the [Agouron Institute](http://www.agi.org), for their generous and ongoing support of the conference and to the [McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences](http://mcss.wustl.edu/) for generous travel support to WashU students.
