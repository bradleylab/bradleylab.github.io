[Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) and [Wil](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/wil/) have just returned from a five day conference on The Sulfur Cycle, sponsored by the [Agouron Institute](http://agi.org). Alex discussed recent chemostat experiments designed to investigate the relationship of sulfur isotope fractionation to sulfate concentrations. Wil discussed his Ph.D. work measuring the sulfur isotope fractionation imposed by the enzyme [dissimilatory sulfite reductase](http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=ENZYME&object=CPLX-266).
