Yesterday afternoon, several members of the lab went on a sampling trip in the greenhouses at the [Danforth Plant Science Center](http://www.danforthcenter.org/). We are collaborating with [Dan Chitwood](http://www.chitwoodlab.org/) on a project using tomato introgression lines to understand genetic loci underlying variations in leaf wax production.
