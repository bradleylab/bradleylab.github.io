Missouri has lots of great carbonate outcrops, and is a great place to learn about this part of the world during the [Paleozoic Era](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/paleozoic/paleozoic.php), as well as a fantastic laboratory for undertaking pilot studies, short field excursions, and working out methods that can be applied to outcrops around the world. This week a small group of students and faculty spent two days collecting carbonates at an outcrop near House Springs, MO. These rocks will be used to try to better understand the analytical precision of geochemical measurements made at high replication. Look for more on this soon!
