[Lauren Johnson](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/lauren/) is starting as a freshman at WashU and has already plunged into science, beginning work in the laboratory. Lauren is interested in planetary science and is studying a Mars analogue site in White Sands, New Mexico, in order to better understand what sorts of biosignatures can be preserved, as well as to compare lab-based geochemical methods to rover-based instrumentation.
