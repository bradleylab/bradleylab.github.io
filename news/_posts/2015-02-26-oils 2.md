[Petroleum](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=40&t=6) is always in the news, but it's not all the same. It can differ in its density, viscosity, pour point, sulfur content, and all manner of geochemical characteristics such as its content of various biomarkers. While most of the world sees crude oil as potential fuel and feedstock, we see it as molecular fossils! Here we have four solvent-dissolved [light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_gravity) crude oils in the early stages of chemical analysis. The leftmost one is a very light (43.2&deg;) sweet [Pennsylvania Grade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Grade_Crude_Oil) oil, while the rightmost one is [Basrah Light](http://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-crudes/assays/middle_east/basra_light.html), an economically important light (33.7&deg;) crude from Iraq. These are examples of just a small bit of the vast variations of crude oils.
