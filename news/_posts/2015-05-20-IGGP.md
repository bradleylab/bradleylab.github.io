[Alex](http://bradleylab.wustl.edu/team/alex/) has just returned from Ireland where he taught a short course within the [Irish Geoscience Graduate Programme](http://www.iggp.ie/) on "Principles and Applications of Organic Geochemistry", covering theoretical and practical aspects of organic geochemistry, with applications ranging from petroleum exploration to climate reconstruction. The course was hosted at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie/), in the heart of downtown Dublin. TCD has an active and growing [Department of Geology](http://www.tcd.ie/Geology/) that emphasizes geological field research combined with cutting-edge analytical techniques. The IGGP course included participants from programs around Ireland.
